## P0 - Complete PHASE 17 real shader-pack compatibility

The synthetic/runtime capability phases are closed; current work is evidence-backed real-pack compatibility on Apple Silicon.

- [x] Define the exact five public statuses: `Supported`, `Partially Supported`, `Fallback`, `Unsupported`, `Broken`.
- [x] Refuse incomplete/unreviewed evidence instead of inferring compatibility from CI, warnings or a plausible image.
- [x] Collect Metal/device/exact heads, pack/log/screenshot SHA-256, real Vitrail draws, raw fallback observations, fatal observations and clean shutdown from one launcher-managed hardware session.
- [x] Keep the shader-pack artifact out of the review bundle.
- [x] Require exactly one fresh F2 screenshot per future launcher run.
- [x] Hash the staged artifact Minecraft actually tested for future launcher runs.
- [x] Add a Vitrail-owned bundle verifier that rejects malformed/extra files and verifies log/screenshot hashes without extracting the archive.
- [x] Fix the generic optional-Distant-Horizons warm-up bug by making warm-up eligibility backend-neutral and refusing unavailable distant families before detached precompile.
- [x] Fix generic active-path pack macro redefinition so a later pack `#define` replaces an earlier active pack definition without blanket-undefining engine/compiler environment macros.
- [x] Real-device verify those two fixes with Vitrail `54f454bc`: Photon, MakeUp and Complementary no longer fail warm-up on unavailable `distant*` programs, and Bliss no longer fails on `diagonal3` redefinition.
- [x] Re-run Photon and verify it compiles past the former `world0/prepare/vertex` blocker, reaches a first full frame and clean shutdown.
- [x] Verify real Photon compute execution after the compile blocker: `world0/deferred4_a` compiles and dispatches on Metal as groups `(1, 1, 1)` / local `(256, 1, 1)` while its fixed oversized shared allocation uses the existing transient-storage fallback.
- [x] Reconfirm a second real compute path with Solas `shadowcomp`, dispatched as groups `(24, 12, 24)` / local `(8, 8, 8)`.
- [ ] Do not promote Photon or any other pack from the 2026-09-18 runtime logs alone. Collect/review the screenshot/reference evidence required by `docs/phase17-compatibility.md` before changing a public compatibility status.
- [ ] Continue the matrix through the remaining required pack families, including BSL-family and Sildur-family coverage, with the same evidence discipline.

The 2026-09-18 runtime sessions exercise Bliss v2.1.2, Complementary Reimagined r5.9.1, MakeUp Ultra Fast 9.5e, Photon v1.3b and Solas Shader V3.7b without a Vitrail/Metallum log-level compile error. The latest run records Vitrail build `37d06c12` and reaches eight first-full-frame events before a clean shutdown. It real-device verifies both the entity `at_midBlock` and particle/weather diagnostic corrections while preserving the affected draw paths. That proves execution progress and diagnostic fixes, not visual/reference correctness.

## P1 - Classify remaining vertex and sampler diagnostics against Iris 26.1

- [x] Correct the entity-shadow `at_midBlock` diagnostic without extending the entity vertex ABI.
  - Iris 26.1 `IrisVertexFormats.ENTITY` carries `iris_Entity`, `mc_midTexCoord` and `at_tangent`, but not `at_midBlock`.
  - Iris 26.1 shader keys use `ENTITY` for ordinary entities and shadow entities.
  - `VertexInputDiagnostics` keeps real mesh-backed answers separate from reference-unbacked inputs; the entity bridge contributes `at_midBlock` only to the missing-input diagnostic filter for regular entity rows.
  - Hardware runs after the fix contain no `at_midBlock` diagnostic while shadow entity draws remain active.
- [x] Classify particle/weather `mc_Entity`, `mc_midTexCoord` and `at_tangent` as reference-unbacked inputs rather than missing real mesh fields.
  - Iris 26.1 `ShaderKey` uses `DefaultVertexFormat.PARTICLE` for both particle keys and weather; that format has no backing element for those three pack extension locations.
  - Iris's core transformer leaves `mc_Entity` untouched when the format reports zero entity components and does not synthesize real `mc_midTexCoord` or `at_tangent` fields for this format.
  - Vitrail keeps the real particle/weather answer set empty and uses its existing deterministic synthesized constants. This is a diagnostic classification only: it does **not** claim value-for-value parity with OpenGL generic-attribute state.
  - The `37d06c12` hardware run shows particle and weather draws across the exercised pack set with the former missing-real-attribute warnings absent.
- [x] Classify the observed sky `mc_Entity` / `mc_midTexCoord` warnings without changing sky mesh formats.
  - Iris 26.1 sky keys use `POSITION`, `POSITION_COLOR`, `POSITION_TEX` or `POSITION_TEX_COLOR`; none carries either extension input.
  - With zero entity components, `VanillaCoreTransformer` leaves a pack-declared `mc_Entity` unbacked. An explicit `mc_midTexCoord` likewise remains an input rather than becoming a sky vertex element.
  - Vitrail keeps the four existing sky formats unchanged and places only those two names in the sky reference-unbacked diagnostic set.
- [x] Classify the observed line-row `vaUV2` / `mc_Entity` warnings without changing the line mesh ABI.
  - Iris 26.1 `LINES` uses `DefaultVertexFormat.POSITION_COLOR_NORMAL_LINE_WIDTH`, which carries neither UV2 nor an entity id.
  - `VanillaCoreTransformer` renames `vaUV2` to `iris_UV2` even when `hasLight()` is false and still declares it as an input; no UV2 element backs it on the line format. Zero entity components likewise leave `mc_Entity` unbacked.
  - `LinesVertex.ANSWERED` remains only `vaPosition`, `vaNormal` and `vaColor`; no line stride or format changes.
- [ ] Re-run at least Solas and Photon after the sky/line diagnostic classification. Verify the five sky and two line missing-real-attribute WARNs from the `37d06c12` log disappear while those sky and line draw paths still execute.
- [ ] Keep comparison-vs-ordinary shadow sampler warnings explicit unless source/reference evidence identifies a defined behavior Vitrail is missing. The current mixed declaration is already diagnosed as undefined under Iris too.
- [ ] Treat `nothing fills them yet` first-frame resource warnings as evidence to investigate only when they correspond to a persistent semantic/visual mismatch; do not convert warning count into a compatibility score.

## P2 - Keep acceptance and documentation synchronized

- [ ] Keep both PRs Draft/open/unmerged while PHASE 17 real-pack acceptance is incomplete.
- [x] Keep `.context/STATE.md`, `.context/TASKS.md` and `docs/metallum-port.md` synchronized with the 2026-09-18 hardware evidence and Iris 26.1 vertex-input findings.
- [ ] Keep Vitrail/Metallum ownership boundaries strict in every follow-up: pack semantics/defaults/diagnostics in Vitrail; generic Metal execution in Metallum.
- [ ] Do not relax startup guards or claim general Metal shader-pack support from one runtime session, CI alone, or the absence of log-level errors.
